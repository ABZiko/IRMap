# IRMap
Iran Map (SVG) For Web Developers !

Iran Map (SVG) has put for web developers who they want to use Iran Map in their websites. Every province that you hover on that, Shows its Province Name to you.

Notice that Two version of Iran Map has uploaded :

1. IR Map with Borders Tooltip
2. IR Map without Borders Tooltip

This Map is Full-Responsive & scalable beacuse using SVG.
I have used Material Design Colors to appear more better. The jQuery Codes are very small to improve loading of IR Map.
The default Font is "IRANSans", So if you want to use another Font, Please change "font-family" property in "style" tag.

Hope to like it !

# Kurdish Version
As soon as possible, I will put Iran Provinces Name to Kurdish (Kurmanji & ...) !
