# IRMap

IRMap (SVG) has been written for web developers who they want to use IRMap in their websites. Every province that you hover on that, Shows its province name.

Notice that Two version of IRMap has been uploaded :

1. IRMap with Borders Tooltip
2. IRMap without Borders Tooltip

The map is responsive & scalable beacuse of using SVG.
I have used "Material Design" colors to appear more better. The jQuery codes are very small to improve loading of IRMap.
The default Font is "IRANSans", So if you want to use another font, Please change ```font-family``` property in ```style``` tag.

# Kurdish Version
As soon as possible, I will put provinces name in Kurdish Language (Kurmanji & ...) !

Hope to like it !
