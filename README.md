# IRMap

**IRMap** has been written for web developers who they want to use ***Iran*** map in their websites. Every province hovering on that Shows its name.

Notice that two version of iran map has been uploaded :
* **With** tooltip for borders
* **Without** tooltip for borders

The map is responsive & scalable beacuse of using ***SVG***. I have used "Material Design" colors to appear more better. ***jQuery*** codes are very small to improve loading. Default font is "IRANSans", So if you want to use another font, Please change `font-family` property in `style` tag.

# Kurdish Version
As soon as possible, I will put provinces name in Kurdish language (Kurmanji & ...).
